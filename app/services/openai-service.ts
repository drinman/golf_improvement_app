- Description of needs and any injuries/limitations: ${description}
- Time availability and practice locations: ${timeAvailability}

Create a detailed, structured practice plan following this format:
1. A title for the practice plan
2. User's goal based on their handicap
3. Key improvement areas extracted from their description (focus heavily on ${focusArea})
4. A brief overview paragraph with general advice for improving in ${focusArea}
5. ${sessionsPerWeek} practice sessions with specific drills tailored to the golfer's needs and focused on ${focusArea}
6. Each session should be on one of their available days, respecting their time constraints and practice locations
7. If the golfer has mentioned any injuries or physical limitations, ensure the plan accommodates these with appropriate modifications
8. Each drill should have clear step-by-step instructions
9. Include a motivational goal for each practice day

The response must be a valid JSON object with this exact format:
{
  "title": "Weekly Golf Practice Plan: [DATE RANGE]",
  "userGoal": "Brief goal based on handicap",
  "improvementFocus": ["Area 1", "Area 2", "Area 3"],

        }
      ]
    }

}

IMPORTANT: Your response must be valid JSON with no markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanatory text outside the JSON. Ensure all durations respect the time availability of each day. Break down drill descriptions into clear instructional steps that are easy to follow. The key thought for each drill should be a short, focused reminder that helps the golfer maintain proper technique. If the golfer has mentioned any injuries or limitations, please ensure the drills are safe and appropriate for their condition.`;
